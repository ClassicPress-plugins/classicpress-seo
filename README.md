# ClassicPress SEO Plugin (Experimental)

ClassicPress SEO is the first SEO plugin built specifically to work with ClassicPress. The plugin contains many essential SEO tools to help improve your search engine rankings.

This plugin was created largely as a result of the following ClassicPress petitions:

- https://petitions.classicpress.net/posts/175/allow-editing-of-page-title-and-meta-description-seo
- https://petitions.classicpress.net/posts/176/auto-xml-sitemap-generation-seo


**Minimum Requirements:**

- ClassicPress 1.0.2
- PHP 7.0

**As this plugin is still in the development & testing stage, please do not use it on a production site.**

## Versioning

ClassicPress SEO will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible. Releases will be numbered
with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`
