== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do you guarantee that traffic to my site will increase? Do you guarantee that traffic to my site will not decrease? =
Sorry but no. No SEO plugin can guarantee anything. Classic SEO will help you to write better content and add special tags or markup 
that are meaningful to Google and other search engines but nobody can guarantee anything where SEO and ranking are concerned.

= Can Classic SEO be used in conjunction with other SEO plugins? =
While technically this may be possible, it is highly inadvisable. It may produce duplicate and unpredictable results. 
It is strongly recommended that other SEO plugins be deactivated.

= Can I transfer settings from other SEO plugins to Classic SEO? =
Yes, support for Rank Math and Yoast are included.

= What are the technical requirements for using Classic SEO? =
* ** ClassicPress 1.0.2 **
* ** PHP 7.0 **
* ** cURL PHP lib **

= Can I use Classic SEO on a WordPress website? =
No. Classic SEO is designed to work only on ClassicPress.
